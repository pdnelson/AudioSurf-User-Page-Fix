// AudioSurf User Page Fix
// Since MS Edge is based on Chromium, maybe it'll work in that, too
// BetaMaster64, Yuvira (2019)

// TO DO:
// Fix shouts
// Improve friend navigation
// Make the header show the logged in user


// Installation is pretty simple. Here's how to do that:

// Chrome:
// Type chrome://extensions in the search/URL bar at the top
// In the top right corner, make sure "Developer mode" is switched on
// Drag and drop the FOLDER (not the individual .js and .json files) into your Chrome extensions window

// Firefox: 
// Type about:debugging as the URL
// Click "Load Temporary Add-on..." in the top right
// Navigate to the extension folder and select either the json or js file

// Opera:
// Type the command, CTRL + Shift + E
// Switch on "Developer mode" in the top right of the page
// Drag and drop the FOLDER (not the individual .js and .json files) into your Opera extensions window

// ...and that's it! You should be able to browse AudioSurf profiles (almost) as if they were never gone...
