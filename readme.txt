// AudioSurf User Page Fix
// Since MS Edge is based on Chromium, maybe it'll work in that, too
// BetaMaster64, Yuvira (2019)

// TO DO:
// Add certain database elements (shouts, viewing friends) that are not present
// These will need pulled from another page, most likely,
// so we will have to have to find a page where that information is displayed
// ***This may not be possible, so the script might be as close to complete as it's gonna get


// Installation is pretty simple. Here's how to do that:

// Chrome:
// Type chrome://extensions in the search/URL bar at the top
// In the top right corner, make sure "Developer mode" is switched on
// Drag and drop the FOLDER (not the individual .js and .json files) into your Chrome Extensions window
// Make sure the extensions is selected

// Firefox: 
// Type about:debugging as the URL
// Click Load Temporary Add-on in the top right
// Navigate to the extension folder and select either the json or js file

// ...and that's it! You should be able to browse AudioSurf profiles (almost) as if they were never gone...
