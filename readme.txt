// AudioSurf User Page Fix
// Since MS Edge is based on Chromium, maybe it'll work in that, too
// BetaMaster64, Yuvira (2019)

// TO DO:
// Add shouts
// Fix friend page number bug
// Make the header logged in user not static


// Installation is pretty simple. Here's how to do that:

// Chrome:
// Type chrome://extensions in the search/URL bar at the top
// In the top right corner, make sure "Developer mode" is switched on
// Drag and drop the FOLDER (not the individual .js and .json files) into your Chrome Extensions window
// Make sure the extensions is selected

// Firefox: 
// Type about:debugging as the URL
// Click Load Temporary Add-on in the top right
// Navigate to the extension folder and select either the json or js file

// ...and that's it! You should be able to browse AudioSurf profiles (almost) as if they were never gone...
